# Book Recommendation System (Console-based DSA Project)

## Overview

This is a beginner-friendly **console-based Python project** that implements a simple **Book Recommendation System** using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The goal is to provide users with the ability to search books by **author** or **genre**, and view **top-rated book suggestions**, all using preloaded data (no database needed).

This project is ideal for students looking to demonstrate practical applications of basic DSA concepts like **lists, sorting, searching, and filtering** in real-world scenarios.

---

## Features

- Search books by **author** name
- Search books by **genre**
- Display **top 5 highest-rated books**
- Preloaded sample book data (no need for user input or file/database setup)
- Built using **pure Python** – no external dependencies

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Console Input/Output**
- **Core DSA Concepts:**
  - List (Array)
  - Linear Search
  - Sorting using `sorted()`
  - Basic filtering
